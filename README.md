## About me

## üöÄ Projects
- [DiamondPriceDashboard](https://github.com/zev-vz/DiamondPriceDashboard) - An RShiny dashboard that democratizes diamond pricing knowledge.

- [TaxiTrips](https://github.com/zev-vz/TaxiTrips) - Analyzed several thousand Chicago taxi trips to uncover patterns in tipping. Applied logistic regression to predict which rides would result in a tip and explored how tipping rate vary across companies.
- [DiamondData](https://github.com/zev-vz/DiamondDate) - Conducted comprehensive analysis of 50,000+ diamond sales. Build machine learning models achieving 98% R¬≤ and generating highly accurate price predictions


### üîÑ Coming Soon
